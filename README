# plaid-penguin-example

A simple example of how to use the 'plaid-penguin library' to set up a
thrift server and client using clojure.

Normally, one would generate the thrift code (you need the thrift
tools installed) by running:

>>> thrift --gen java simple.thrift

Then compile those to java using:

>>> lein javac

But this is already done for this example. 

Just run: 

>>> lein deps
>>> cp log4j.properties lib/
>>> lein run 9000
